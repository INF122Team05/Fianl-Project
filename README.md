For compiling and executing:

1. Open and build the project as a normal Java project
2. To run each game, navigate to either package src/bejeweled or src/candycrush
3. Using the main methods in the Launcher.java files in each package, set that as the main method to run
4. You should then be prompted in the command prompt to login/create an account after running Launcher.java
5. Once logged in, you are presented with a list of games to select from. In this case, the games are split up, so you will only see that Launcher's game
6. The GUI should also have been ran. Pull up that window and enter the name of a game from the list in the corresponding text box
7. Click the Start button to start the timer and enter selections in the bottom text box with the format: a,b,c,d which correlates to swapping block at (a,b) with block at (c,d)
8. The Grid is numbered 1-6 where the top left corner is 1,1 and the bottom right corner is 6,6
